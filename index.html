    1: "Energy 1 — You are a pioneer, born to create what no one else has created before. When people like you emerge, great revolutions happen in the world. You have the power to lead others, to manage and guide them. You can help people grow on a large scale and inspire them to follow you through your ideas and actions. Your greatest challenge is the fear of stepping forward, of being a leader, and of leading others. Yet, you possess tremendous potential for this! You can be a strong entrepreneur, a businesswoman, and lead vast crowds of people. All you need to do is unlock your financial triangle and discover your true potential.",
    2: "Energy 2 — This means you are born to unite people and support them  especially women and children. You possess the gift of persuasion, strong intuition, and the ability to build meaningful connections. You have the power to transform others through your voice, ancestral strength, and the knowledge accessible to you from the universal library. Your greatest challenge is a deep-rooted feeling of being unloved. You often diminish your own worth, constantly focusing on your flaws. It may seem like others are better or more impressive than you  but this is a false belief. In truth, people like you possess a powerful gift for extrasensory perception. You can read others deeply and intuitively, and numerology is especially well-suited to your nature. You simply need to uncover your true purpose and scale your unique abilities.",
    3: "Energy 3 — You are born to inspire others through your example to spark transformation and impact on a global scale. You are a deeply creative and talented individual, capable of becoming a role model for millions. You are meant to be seen, to stand on stage, to shine. Threes are often popular bloggers, trendsetting influencers  and abundance flows to them through children. The more children around them, the more prosperity they attract. Your greatest challenge is the fear of being visible. Putting yourself out there on social media and showing the world who you are that is the one step separating you from true success. This inner fear causes you to swing from one extreme to another. You may immerse yourself completely in motherhood, becoming a supermom dedicated to your children and partner, avoiding work and personal fulfillment. Or, you might swing the other way diving into business and neglecting family life altogether. The key is balance  right in the middle. Your superpower lies in working with women and expressing yourself among women. But first, you must discover exactly where and how to step into your full expression.",
    4: "Energy 4 —  You are born to be a world builder to create new fundamental directions, make discoveries, and develop businesses that help others stand on their own and transform. Your greatest challenge is workaholism. You carry the weight of everything on your shoulders. Even when you are not working professionally, you take responsibility for everything at home. You constantly strive to help everyone and save those around you. Often, your hard work goes unappreciated, and the people close to you tend to be consumers of your efforts. Your superpower lies in channeling this dynamic into your own business, rather than spending your life working for others. You simply need to unlock your full potential.",
    5: "Energy 5 — This means you are born to be a spiritual mentor and teacher to others. Your mission is to transmit all the knowledge and information that comes to you. You have the ability to integrate diverse knowledge into your own teaching and transform the consciousness of others. Your greatest challenge is dispersion. You are constantly exploring different paths, always learning and seeking new knowledge. Because of this, you struggle to focus on one thing and finally begin to earn significant income. Endless learning and a conservative mindset that fears embracing the new and tends to reject it, these are your main blocks to overcome. Because, in truth, you are a spiritual guided.",
    6: "Energy 6 — This means you are born under the energy of 6 — here to teach others how to love themselves and to recognize the beauty in the world around them. You have the gift of creating beauty and opening the hearts of others. Those born under the energy of 6 often carry the vibration of true love, purity, and harmony. They are natural artists, actors, presenters, and content creators. When you follow your path and align with the areas where your greatest abundance lies, your personal and professional growth can be rapid and expansive. Your greatest challenge is being overly critical of your own appearance and sense of beauty. You have a sensitive soul , easily wounded, deeply attuned to the emotions and energies around you. This sensitivity, while a gift, can also become a block. But when you truly accept yourself, love yourself as you are, and stop dissolving into others' needs or identities, your potential for growth becomes limitless.",
    7: "Energy 7 — This means you are the kind of person capable of revolutions. You are born to uncover meanings, get to the truth, and make discoveries that others cannot. You are a cosmic being without a home, borders, or the concept of the impossible. Your greatest challenge is the fear of expansion and growth. You hesitate to make quantum leaps, to relocate, or to embrace the new. You also struggle with laziness. The downside of the number seven is often lethargy, slowness, reluctance to dive deeply, abandoning goals halfway through all of which are strictly forbidden for you. Because your superpower is quantum leaps and rapid growth. You just need to know where to direct yourself.",
    8: "Energy 8 — This means you are born under the energy of 8  to expand the financial potential of this world by recognizing cause-and-effect patterns and understanding the laws of karma. You have the ability to create true balance between the spiritual and the material. You carry the most financially abundant energy in numerology, with enormous potential for building your own business and creating long-term wealth. Your greatest challenge is an intensified sense of justice. You often find yourself in internal conflict, constantly trying to make sure everything is fair and \"done right\", but in the process, you forget to live for yourself.",
    9: "Energy 9 — You are a natural healer. You didn't come into this world by accident — you are here to heal others by restoring their minds, bodies, and souls through your powerful energy. Those born under the energy of 9 often carry a deep soul mission to uplift and transform those around them. Your greatest challenge is the impostor syndrome. You tend to undervalue your knowledge and constantly feel like you're not \"good enough\" to begin. You also carry the rescuer complex  the urge to help everyone but yourself: working for free, avoiding raising your rates, and prioritizing the needs of your mother, grandmother, partner, or father. In the end, you pour all your energy into other only to say there's nothing left for yourself. But in truth, this is one of the most spiritually profound energies in numerology. And the moment you turn inward  into self-discovery, inner work, and practices like numerology you unlock your true calling."

Examples:\n• A joyful purchase\n• Guilt-free alone time\n• Journaling or a heart-to-heart with your reflection\n• Eating a meal slowly and with delight\n• A massage or skincare ritual\n\nSay to yourself a phrase you often say to others:\n\"You deserve peace, beauty, and care\" — and direct it inward.",
    questions: "What do I give to others that I deny myself?\nWhere has care become an obligation instead of a joy?\nWhat kind of woman do I want to become — for myself, not for others' approval?\nWhat can I do to help my inner child feel safe and loved?"

    title: "7 — Ritual of Presence, Inner Depth, and Self-Anchoring",
    blocks: "Living \"in your head\": overthinking without action.\nEmotional withdrawal and isolation.\nConstant analysis and self-criticism.\nIgnoring the body and its signals.\nTrying to find the \"perfect\" answer before moving forward.",
    expands: "Grounding and awareness of bodily sensations.\nWalking, breathing, water rituals\nThe ability to pause and ask: \"What do I really feel?\"\nRespect for your boundaries and emotions.",
    ritual: "Do a body-centered practice that grounds you. For example:\n• Walk barefoot or take a walk alone.\n• Soak in a salt bath.\n• Belly breathing (slow and downward).\n• Gentle self-touch with full acceptance.\n\nSay aloud and calmly:\n\"I allow money (and life) to support my wisdom and presence.\"",
    questions: "Where is there too much thinking and too little sensing in my life?\nWhat does my body tell me when I stop listening to it?\nWhat happens when I simply allow myself to be?\nWhat is my true way to slow down and feel?"
  },

    expands: "Financial decisions made from inner confidence.\nOwning the value of your work.\nTaking a clear stance in communication and business.\nActions that say: \"I lead, I'm not dependent.\"\nScaling up not through chaos, but through clear ambition.",
    ritual: "Make one bold decision you've been putting off, such as:\n• Raising your prices.\n• Launching a new product or service.\n• Making a clear offer without downplaying it.\n• Reaching a new audience.\n• Letting go of something draining (even if it brings income).\n\nStand in a power pose: tall, open posture — calm yet strong. Say:\n\"I deserve significant money and respect for my strength and contribution.\"",
    questions: "Where do I lower my value for comfort or loyalty?\nWhat part of me is afraid to be strong, expensive, influential?\nWhat decisions am I postponing because I'm not ready to be seen?\nHow would a woman act who knows she is her own foundation?"
  },

    expands: "Conscious closure of past stages and stories.\nWillingness to let go of what no longer feeds you\nSharing knowledge, experience, support\nFinding meaning in all life experiences — even painful ones.\nTurning pain into strength and value for others",
    ritual: "Write two letters:\n\n1. A letter of letting go: \"Who or what do I want to release — and why is this no longer mine?\" Burn or tear it to symbolize closure.\n\n2. A letter of service: \"How can I serve the world through what I've lived through?\" This can be something you publish — or keep for yourself.\n\nThis is not about being a victim. It's about a meaningful contribution. Meaning creates flow.",
    questions: "What am I holding onto, even though I know it's run its course?\nWhat past experience could become a resource rather than a burden?\nWhat am I afraid of if I let go of the old?\nHow can I serve others — not from sacrifice, but from maturity?"
